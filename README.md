# JavaScript Style Guide

This is my guide for writing consistent JavaScript code.

## Table of contents

* [Indention](#2-spaces-for-indention)
* [Newlines](#newlines)
* [No trailing whitespace](#no-trailing-whitespace)
* [Use Semicolons](#use-semicolons)

## 2 Spaces for indention

Use 2 spaces for indenting your code and swear an oath to never mix tabs and
spaces - a special kind of hell is awaiting you otherwise.

## Newlines

Use UNIX-style newlines (`\n`), and a newline character as the last character
of a file. Windows-style newlines (`\r\n`) are forbidden inside any repository.

## No trailing whitespace

Just like you brush your teeth after every meal, you clean up any trailing
whitespace in your JS files before committing. Otherwise the rotten smell of
careless neglect will eventually drive away contributors and/or co-workers.

## Use Semicolons

According to [scientific research][hnsemicolons], the usage of semicolons is
a core value of our community. Consider the points of [the opposition][], but
be a traditionalist when it comes to abusing error correction mechanisms for
cheap syntactic pleasures.
